# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning Algorithms and Model Integration with Web Framework
For the detection of fraudulent activity in financial transactions, machine learning has proved to be a valuable tool.Machine learning algorithms are able to detect potentially fraudulent behavior with considerable accuracy and effectiveness by analyzing patterns and anomalies across a wide range of datasets. In this project, we will utilize four different machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, KNN, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree) to develop a model that can accurately predict the likelihood of credit card fraud based on the provided features. A successful detection of credit card fraud through machine learning could lead to reduced financial losses and improve overall safety in the use of cards. # Credit_Card_Fraud_DetectionFor the detection of fraudulent activity in financial transactions, machine learning has proved  to be a valuable tool.
